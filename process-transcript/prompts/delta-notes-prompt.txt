"""Here is a story told by someone with chronic Low Back Pain (cLBP):

Here is an excerpt from the transcript of an interview discussing the
previous version of their story:

<excerpt>
{excerpt}
</excerpt>

Given the story and the transcript excerpt, identify parts of the
story they identified as mistakes, wrong, or incorrect. List those
issues that should be corrected. Also identify new information in the
transcript that isn't in the story. And list that new
information. Because these are excerpts, do not summarize the
findings. Simply list and describe them. If there is nothing to
report, simply respond with 'No content present.' Only take notes on
what the interviewee says. Tom's (the interviewer) comments are only
context, not primary content. Do not take notes on issues with this
Zoom conference like not being able to share screens or internet/wifi
connectivity. Format the response as a list of bullets, one bullet
line. Put all the notes in the bullet list. Do not add any extra text
outside the list. Include only the bullets.
