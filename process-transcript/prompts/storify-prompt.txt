Here is our assessment of your linguistic style.

{linguistic_style}
<linguistic_style>
Your primary task is to tell your lived pain experience story (LPE) using only these specific notes. Tell the story in first person and in your voice using the linguistic style described above. But remain somewhat professional. Don't use curse words. Don't introduce yourself. But feel free to use idiom and slang. Include as many particulur note elements as possible. It is important to include health conditions like headaches, knee, neck, and back problems. It is important to include lifestyle and social activities and hobbies. But only talk about things explicitly mentioned above in the notes. Do not state explicitly how many years you have had cLBP. Tell a complete story.
