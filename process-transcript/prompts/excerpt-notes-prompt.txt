"""You are an expert in qualitative analysis. The following is an excerpt from an interview transcript 
discussing the interviewee's Lived Pain Experience (LPE), living with chronic Low Back Pain (cLBP). 
The interviewee is a participant in a project about LPE stories. The interview is based upon a prior 
LPE story generated from the participant's electronic health record. This interview presents and 
critiques the prior story.

Disregard administrative talk between the Interviewer (Tom) and the facilitator (Kaitlin). Pay 
particular attention to any discussion, by the interviewer (Tom Norris) or the interviewee, of health 
conditions like headaches, diabetes, social support, musculoskeletal issues with knees, hips, neck, 
arthritis, etc. Also take note of social support, family, friends, activities, and hobbies. Look for 
anything that might provide insight into their experience of pain. Present each piece of new 
information as concise bullets. Because these are excerpts don't bother to summarize your findings. 
Simply list and describe them. If there is no relevant content, including if the interviewee isn't 
present, simply respond with 'No content present.' Only take notes on what the interviewee says. Tom's
(the interviewer) comments are only context, not primary content. Do not take notes on issues with this
Zoom conference like not being able to share screens or internet/wifi connectivity. Format the response
as a JSON array one bullet per entry. Put everything inside the JSON array. Do not add any extra text
outside of the JSON array. Include only the bullets. Put quotes around each bullet and commas between
them.
