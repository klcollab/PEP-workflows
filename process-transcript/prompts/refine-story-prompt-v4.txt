</script>

Given the transcript notes, revise the script. Correct any errors
identified in the notes. If no errors were mentioned, do not change
that part of the script. Preserve the linguistic style of the script.
Keep as much of the script as possible intact. Do not change the text
unless you must. Do not rewrite any part of the script unless
correcting an error.
